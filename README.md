# sql_python_powerbi_integrated_project
An integrated sales &amp; revenue analysis project utilizing MySQL, Python &amp; Power BI.

Problem Statement :

1) Import data into MySQL database. 
2) Perform data cleaning and transformation using Python. 
3) Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights. 

Load the datasets and clean them by using python: 
-  Clean and perform necessary operations on data.
-  Create a new column in the sales data to calculate total_sale_amount (quantity sold Ã— price). 

Insert the cleaned data into mysql database/ Excel file. 

Power BI (Dashboard) 
Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI from mysql database/ Excel file. 
Create a dashboard that includes the following visuals: -  A bar chart showing revenue by product category. -  A map displaying revenue by region. -  A line chart showing monthly revenue trends for 2023. -  A table listing the top 5 products by revenue. - Include additional insights based on business requirements. 
Ensure the dashboard is interactive and user-friendly, with proper filters and labels.

Dataset Information

By using a SQL Script, data is stored in database named jforce by inserting it into three tables namely Customers, Sales and Products.

A) The Customers table contains 300 rows and 6 columns namely 1) customer_id 2) customer_name 3) gender 4) age 5) city 6) join_date

B) The Sales table contains 300 rows and 7 columns namely 1) sale_id 2) product_id 3) customer_id 4) quantity_sold 5) sale_amount 6) sale_date 7) region

C) The Products table contains 18 rows and 4 columns namely 1) product_id 2) product_name 3) category 4) price

# Steps followed to solve this problem
1) Created a database named "jforce" in MySQL
2) Created 3 tables named Customers, Sales, Products and inserted data into these tables by running a SQL Script.
3) Created a Python Jupyter notebook file, established connection with MySQL using MySQL-python connector.
4) Feteched data from the database tables using the cursor object and stored the data in their respective dataframes.
5) Closed the connection established
6) Performed data-cleaning, pre-processing and feature engineering using Python's pandas library
7) Exported the datasets to excel files.
8) Imported the cleaned and processed data sets in Power BI.
9) Performed additonal data-cleaning, processing and modelling.
10) Built various suitable and relevant visuals according to the problem statement.

# What does the Power BI Report contain
The Power BI Report contains 2 tabs namely 1) Revenue Dashboard and 2) Sales Dashboard

The Structure of the Revenue and Sales Dashboard is the same with both containing 6 visuals, 7 slicers and a title box.

The Revenue Dashboard shows
1) Total Revenue by Category Stacked Bar-chart
2) Total Revenue by Month Line-chart
3) Total Revenue by Region Map-chart
4) Total Revenue by Gender Bar-chart
5) Total Revenue by Age-group Histogram
6) Top 7 customers by revenue table
7) Top 7 products by revenue table

Similarly, 

The Sales Dashboard shows
1) Total Sales by Category Stacked Bar-chart
2) Total Sales by Month Line-chart
3) Total Sales by Region Map-chart
4) Total Sales by Gender Bar-chart
5) Total Sales by Age-group Histogram
6) Top 7 customers by Sales table
7) Top 7 products by Sales table

Data in both these tabs can be sliced and diced by 7 Slicers namely Product Name, City, Sales Date, Category, Price Range, Gender and Region to analyze data as required to gather valuable insights to make informed business decisions.
